## Documentation

Further documentation about this module can be found in the [/doc/](doc) folder:

* [Guide](doc/guide.md) - introduction for developers
* [Circulationrules](doc/circulationrules.md) - how the circulation rules file and the circulation rules engine work

## Goal

FOLIO compatible circulation capabilities, including loan items from the inventory.

## Prerequisites

### Required

- Java 8 JDK
- Maven 3.5.0
- Implementations of the interfaces described in the [module descriptor](descriptors/ModuleDescriptor-template.json)

### Optional

- Python 3 (for un-registering module during managed demo and tests via Okapi, and the lint-raml tools)

## Preparation

### Git Submodules

There are some common RAML definitions that are shared between FOLIO projects via Git submodules.

To initialise these please run `git submodule init && git submodule update` in the root directory.

If these are not initialised, the inventory-storage module will fail to build correctly, and other operations may also fail.

More information is available on the [developer site](https://dev.folio.org/guides/developer-setup/#update-git-submodules).

## Common activities

### Running a general build

In order to run a general build (including the default tests), run `mvn test`.

### Creating the circulation module JAR

In order to build an executable Jar (e.g. for Okapi to deploy), run `mvn package`.

### Running the tests

#### Using fake modules

In order to run the tests, using a fake loan storage module, run ./quick-test.sh.

#### Using real modules (via Okapi)

In order to run the tests against a real storage module, run ./test-via-okapi.sh.

This requires [Okapi](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi) to be running and the relevant modules to be registered with it.

The test script will create a tenant and activate the modules for that tenant.

In order to change the specific versions of these dependencies, edit the test-via-okapi.sh script.

### Checking the RAML and JSON.Schema definitions

Follow the [guide](https://dev.folio.org/guides/raml-cop/) to use raml-cop to assess RAML, schema, and examples.

## Design Notes

### Known Limitations

#### Requests Created out of Request Date Order

Requests are assigned a position based upon when they were created.
This means the requests could be in a different position in the queue than what
the request date suggests. We could re-order to queue based upon request date
each time it is changed, however this would impede the future requirement
for the ability to reorder the queue manually.

#### Creating an already closed loan

It is not possible to create a loan that is already closed via POST
due to checks that are performed during this request.
However it can be done when creating a loan in a specific location via PUT

#### API Tests

As it is intended that API tests can be run against real module instances,
some scenarios are not easily replicated without breaking this capability.

For example, previously there were tests that verified that some of the APIs
could handle missing inventory records. As mod-inventory-storage does not allow
used holdings or instance records to be deleted, these tests were removed.

These tests need to be replaced by tests that use specialised implementations
of the storage interfaces, separate to the fakes used for general API tests.

#### Tenant-selected timezone and locale support

* Tenant-selected timezone is supported only for check-out and renewal (and not for overridden renewals or request creation)
* Date formatting for patron notices does not respect tenant-selected locale

#### Patron notices

Patron notices are only implemented for check-in and check-out


### Check Out By Barcode

In additional to the typical loan creation API, it is possible to check out an item to a loanee (optionally via a proxy), using barcodes.

#### Example Request

```
POST http://{okapi-location}/circulation/check-out-by-barcode
{
    "itemBarcode": "036000291452",
    "userBarcode": "5694596854",
    "loanDate": "2018-03-18T11:43:54.000Z"
}
```

### Circulation Rules Caching

The circulation rules engine used for applying circulation rules has an internal, local cache which is refreshed every 5 seconds and when a PUT to /circulation/rules changes the circulation rules.

This is per module instance, and so may result in different responses during this window after the circulation rules are changed.

### Circulation Rules

[doc/circulationrules.md](doc/circulationrules.md)

That document explains how the circulation rules engine calculates the loan policy (that specifies the loan period)
based on the patron's patron group and the item's material type, loan type, and location.

### Item Status

During the circulation process an item can change between a variety of states,
below is a table describing the most common states defined at the moment.

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| Available | This item is available to be lent to a patron |
| Checked out | This item is currently checked out to a patron |
| Awaiting pickup | This item is awaiting pickup by a patron who has a request at the top of the queue|

### Request Status

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| Open - Not yet filled | The requested item is not yet available to the requesting user |
| Open - Awaiting pickup | The item is available to the requesting user |
| Closed - Filled | |

### Storing Information from Other Records

In order to facilitate the searching and sorting of requests by the properties of related records, a snapshot of some
properties are stored with the request.

This snapshot is updated during POST or PUT requests by requesting the current state of those records.
It is possible for them to become out of sync with the referenced records.

the request JSON.schema uses the readOnly property to indicate that these properties, from the perspective of the client, are read only.

#### Properties Stored

##### Requesting User (referenced by requesterId, held in requester property)

* firstName
* lastName
* middleName
* barcode

##### Proxy Requesting User (referenced by proxyUserId, held in proxy property)

* firstName
* lastName
* middleName
* barcode

##### Requested Item (referenced by itemId, held in item property)

* title
* barcode

### Including Properties From Other Records

In order to reduce the amount of requests a client needs to make, some properties from other records in responses.

As this inclusion requires a chain of requests after the loans or requests have been fetched, the responses may take longer than other requests.

#### Loans

Loans include information from the item, including locations, holdingsRecordId and instanceId.

#### Requests

Requests include information from the item, including holdingsRecordId and instanceId.

#### Hold shelf clearance report

To create hold expiration report that can be used by staff to clear expired and cancelled holds from the shelf and put them back into circulation.
Then generate a report based on this logic:
* Find all of the items that are `Awaiting pickup`
* Choose the item’s which either have an empty request queue or request queue doesn't contain request with status `Open - Awaiting pickup`
* Select the request for each item that expired or was cancelled on the hold shelf most recently (by ranking the closed requests by a date used only for this purpose)
* Choose only the requests where the `pickup service point` matches the chosen service point

The API for generating a report is based on the presence of the 'awaitingPickupRequestClosedDate' property for the request JSONB.
Such behavior is required by database trigger for request update in the mod-circulation-storage
See [CIRCSTORE-127](https://issues.folio.org/browse/CIRCSTORE-127)

Data involved in the formation of the report:
* Requester name: lastName, firstName
* Requester barcode
* Item title
* Item barcode
* Call number
* Request status
* Hold shelf expiration date: Date with timestamp

#### Example Request

```
GET http://{okapi-location}/circulation/requests-reports/hold-shelf-clearance/:{servicePointId}
```

#### Example Success Response
